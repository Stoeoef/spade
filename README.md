# spade

Delaunay triangulations for the rust ecosystem.

 - 2D [Delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation), optionally backed 
   by a hierarchy structure for improved nearest neighbor and insertion performance.
 - Allows both incremental and bulk loading creation of triangulations
 - Support for vertex removal
 - 2D constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT)
 - [Delaunay refinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_refinement)
 - Uses precise geometric predicates to prevent incorrect geometries due to rounding issues
 - Supports extracting the Voronoi diagram
 - Natural neighbor interpolation

# Project goals

Project goals, in the order of their importance:

 1. Robustness - all data structures should behave correctly. An incorrect result, even if triggered only under rare circumstances, is not acceptable. This is why Spade uses a precise calculation kernel by default.
 2. Easy to use - favor an easy to use API over an API that exposes all bells and whistles.
 3. Performance - Delaunay triangulations are often a low level component of an application. Optimization in this area pays off greatly.
 4. Small footprint - Spade should be a sensible library to include in your project that doesn't require too many dependencies. Bigger dependencies will be feature gated when possible.

# Roadmap

For Spade 3:
 - Possibly API simplification by un-supporting non-f64 outputs.
