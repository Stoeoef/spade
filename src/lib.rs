/// Handle types used for traversal and modification of triangulations.
///
/// A handle can either be a "reference handle" or a "fixed handle". Reference handles are
/// used for immutable access to a triangulation. Fixed handles allow mutation but have a
/// more limited API.
///
/// # Reference handles
/// Reference handles come in one of four variants:
/// * [FaceHandle](handles::FaceHandle)s refer to a single face (triangle) of the triangulation.
///   They are used get the triangle's adjacent vertices and edges. They also may refer to
///    the single outer face.
/// * [VertexHandle](handles::VertexHandle)s refer to a single vertex of the triangulation. They
///   allow to retrieve the vertex position and its outgoing edges.
/// * [DirectedEdgeHandle](handles::DirectedEdgeHandle)s refer to a single directed edge. They
///   allow to retrieve the edges origin and destination vertex, its adjacent face as well as
///   its previous and next edge.
/// * [UndirectedEdgeHandle](handles::UndirectedEdgeHandle)s refer to an edge without specifying its
///   direction.
///
/// All handles also allow to set and retrieve arbitrary additional data associated with that
/// element. Refer to the type parameters of [Triangulation] for more details.
///
/// # Fixed handles
/// Reference handles all hold an immutable reference to the underlying triangulation.
/// This reference is used to implement a feature rich and intuitive API. However,
/// due to Rust's ownership semantics, modification of a triangulation
/// can not be done using these handles as that would require a mutable reference. This is
/// required in some cases, e.g. whenever traversal of the triangulation is mixed with insertion
/// operations or when attempting to remove vertices.
/// As a solution, Spade relies on _fixed_ handles for mutation: These are created from normal
/// handles by calling `some_handle.fix()` and do not keep a reference to the triangulation.
///
/// Internally, fixed handles are implemented as indices into a `Vec`. **Removing elements from
/// the triangulation can possibly invalidate any fixed handle**. Attempting to resolve an invalid
/// handle may either refer to a different element or panic at run time. It is the callers
/// responsibility to make sure that fixed handles are not used anymore after a removal operation
/// has taken place.
///
/// Fixed handles also come in four variants, depending on which element they refer to:
///  * [FixedVertexHandle](handles::FixedVertexHandle)
///  * [FixedFaceHandle](handles::FixedFaceHandle)
///  * [FixedDirectedEdgeHandle](handles::FixedDirectedEdgeHandle)
///  * [FixedUndirectedEdgeHandle](handles::FixedUndirectedEdgeHandle)
///
/// # Retrieving handles by iteration
///
/// The [Triangulation] trait defines iterators for all handle types:
///
/// |                | Vertices | Directed Edges  | Undirected Edges | Faces |
/// |----------------|----------|-----------------|------------------|-------|
/// | **Reference**  | [vertices()](Triangulation::vertices()) | [directed_edges()](Triangulation::directed_edges) | [undirected_edges()](Triangulation::undirected_edges()) | [inner_faces()](Triangulation::inner_faces())<br>[all_faces()](Triangulation::all_faces()) |
/// | **Fixed**      | [fixed_vertices()](Triangulation::fixed_vertices()) | [fixed_directed_edges()](Triangulation::fixed_directed_edges()) | [fixed_undirected_edges()](Triangulation::fixed_undirected_edges()) | [fixed_inner_faces()](Triangulation::fixed_inner_faces())<br> [fixed_faces()](Triangulation::fixed_inner_faces()) |
///
/// # Creating handles directly
///
/// In some cases it may be desireable to create vertex handles artificially by providing the index
/// manually. This can be done by calling [handles::FixedVertexHandle::from_index](from_index(usize)).
/// Make sure that the provided index is smaller than the number of vertices in the triangulation.
///
/// # Converting between reference and fixed handles
///
/// Converting a reference handle into its fixed counterpart is performed via the
/// `fix()` method (defined on any handle type).
///
/// Converting a fixed handle type back into a reference handle requires calling either
/// [Triangulation::vertex], [Triangulation::face],
/// [Triangulation::directed_edge] or [Triangulation::undirected_edge].
///
/// # Example: Using handles
/// This example implements a nearest neighbor algorithm on a delaunay triangulation. Starting
/// from an arbitrary start vertex, it greedily walks to the closes vertex until arriving at a
/// local minimum. Due to the special properties of Delaunay triangulations, this is also the
/// global nearest neighbor.
///
/// _Note: Spade already implements this method, see [DelaunayTriangulation::nearest_neighbor]_
/// ```
